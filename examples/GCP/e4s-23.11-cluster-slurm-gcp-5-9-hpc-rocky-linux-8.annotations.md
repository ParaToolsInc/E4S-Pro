       Ensure that this matches the name of your project on GCP
2. !!! info
       Ensure that this matches the image family from the GCP marketplace
3. !!! danger
       `0.0.0.0/0` exposes TCP port 22 the entire world, fine for testing ephemeral clusters,
       but for persistent clusters you should limit traffic to your organizations IP range or
       a hardened bastion server
4. !!! info
       The `machine_type` and `node_count_dynamic_max` should be set to reflect the instance
       types and number of nodes you would like to use. These are spun up dynamically. You
       must ensure that you have sufficient quota to run with the number of vCPUs = (cores
       per node)*(node_cound_dynamic_max). For compute intensive, tightly coupled jobs, C3
       or H3 instances have shown good performance.
5. !!! info
       This example includes an additional SLURM partition containing H3 nodes. At the time
       of this writing, access to H3 instances was limited and you may need to request access
       via a quota increase request. You do not need multiple SLURM partitions, and may
       consider removing this one.
6. !!! info
       To access the full [high-speed per-VM Tier_1 networking capabilities][Tier_1 networking] on supported instance types, the
       [gvnic] must be enabled.
