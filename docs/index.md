# ParaTools Pro for E4S™

The Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack [(E4S™)][1] is a broad collection of HPC focused [software packages][2]. E4S provides a unified computing environment for deployment of open-source projects. E4S includes contributions from many organizations, including national laboratories, universities, and industry. E4S packages are deployed and managed via [Spack][3]. E4S was originally developed to provide a common software environment for the exascale leadership computing systems currently being deployed at DOE National Laboratories across the U.S. 

ParaTools Pro for E4S™ takes E4S and deploys it to containers that are hardened and optimized for use on commercial clouds. It adds additional valuable features such as enhanced MPI performance, a performant remote desktop interface, and extra, optimized software packages for a variety of AI and other HPC applications. ParaTools Pro for E4S™ also adds deployment and development support from ParaTools, Inc. ParaTools Pro for E4S™ is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's SBIR program.
