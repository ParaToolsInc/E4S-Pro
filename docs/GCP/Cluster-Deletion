## Proper Deletion
It is very important that when you are done using the cluster you must use ghcp to destroy it. When a cluster is created, ghcp creates resources and adds project metadata tags, if improperly deleted, some of these will remain and you will be charged for them. To delete your cluster correctly, find the instructions in the folder created by ghpc, `CLUSTER-IMAGE/instructions.txt` and do   
```
./ghpc destroy CLUSTER-IMAGE/
```

## Improper Deletion
### Case 1
When the compute instances are deleted, but not the folder, you can run the command `./ghpc destroy CLUSTER-IMAGE/` and it should properly remove all the created resources. You should also run `rm -rf CLUSTER-IMAGE/` to remove the file.
### Case 2
When the folder hasn't been deleted, and you attempt to create the cluster again, you may get the error
```
  Error: Failed to overwrite existing deployment.
		
		Use the -w command line argument to enable overwrite.
		If overwrite is already enabled then this may be because you are attempting to remove a deployment group, which is not supported.
    original error: the directory already exists: e4s-23-11-cluster-slurm-rocky8
```
In this case remove the folder as stated above.
### Case 3
If you are getting the below errors, it indicates ghpc is unable to recreate a cluster due to leftover resources.
